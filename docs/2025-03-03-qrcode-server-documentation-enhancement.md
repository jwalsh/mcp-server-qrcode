# MCP QR Code Server Documentation Enhancement

**Date**: March 3, 2025
**Author**: Jason Walsh
**Project**: MCP QR Code Server

## Overview

Completed a comprehensive documentation enhancement project for the MCP QR Code Server, focusing on improving developer onboarding and release processes.

## Timeline

- **16:00-16:45**: Initial review and architecture documentation
- **16:45-17:15**: Created architecture diagram with Mermaid
- **17:15-17:45**: Enhanced client integration documentation
- **17:45-18:15**: Refined release process and testing sections

## Accomplishments

1. Created a visual architecture diagram showing component relationships
2. Expanded Emacs integration documentation with practical examples
3. Reorganized and enhanced the release process with clear, numbered steps
4. Added thorough testing and troubleshooting sections
5. Successfully verified the documentation by performing a full release cycle
6. Released version 1.1.0 to npm and GitHub

## Issues Encountered

1. **npx execution issues**: Direct execution with `npx @jwalsh/mcp-server-qrcode` fails with "command not found". 
   - **Workaround**: Global installation (`npm install -g`) works correctly.
   - **TODO**: Investigate bin field in package.json to ensure correct binary paths.

2. **Missing tarballs cleanup**: Multiple tarballs accumulated during testing.
   - **Resolution**: Added cleanup step (`rm -f *.tgz`) before `npm pack` in release process.

3. **Test output formatting**: QR code ASCII art in test results displayed incorrectly.
   - **Resolution**: Added `:results raw :wrap example` to org-mode code blocks.

## Next Steps

1. Fix npx execution issue for better Claude Desktop integration
2. Implement continuous integration with GitHub Actions
3. Improve test coverage (currently below threshold)
4. Consider adding examples for all resource types

## Conclusion

The documentation enhancements significantly improve the developer experience and provide clear guidance for contributing to and maintaining the project. The successful 1.1.0 release validates the documentation accuracy and completeness.
