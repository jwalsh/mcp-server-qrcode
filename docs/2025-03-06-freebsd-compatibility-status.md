# FreeBSD Compatibility Status Report

Date: 2025-03-06  
Author: Claude

## Current Status

The MCP QR Code Server has been tested on FreeBSD, revealing several compatibility issues that have been documented and partially addressed. The core functionality works correctly when using appropriate GNU utilities, but some build tooling requires adjustments.

## Identified Issues

1. **Make Compatibility**: 
   - FreeBSD's `make` is incompatible with the GNU Make syntax used in the Makefile
   - Solution: Use `gmake` instead of `make` on FreeBSD systems
   - Status: âœ… Documented in CLAUDE.md

2. **Grep Incompatibility**:
   - FreeBSD's grep lacks extended regex features used in the Makefile help target
   - Error: `grep: repetition-operator operand invalid`
   - Solution: Install GNU grep (`pkg install gnugrep`) and modify scripts to use `ggrep`
   - Status: ðŸ”¶ Documented but not fixed in code

3. **Shell Utilities**:
   - Some shell scripts may rely on GNU-specific options for core utilities
   - Solution: Install GNU coreutils (`pkg install coreutils`) and update scripts to use prefixed versions (gdate, gls, etc.)
   - Status: ðŸ”¶ Documented but not verified

## Recommended Changes

Short-term (1-2 weeks):
1. Update Makefile to detect OS type and use appropriate commands
2. Modify the help target to be FreeBSD-compatible or use a platform-independent approach
3. Test all shell scripts on FreeBSD and update as needed

Medium-term (1-2 months):
1. Create a FreeBSD CI pipeline to ensure continued compatibility
2. Add a dedicated FreeBSD setup guide to DEVELOPERS.org
3. Ensure all development tooling works correctly on FreeBSD

## Timeline

- âœ… **2025-03-06**: Initial FreeBSD compatibility testing and documentation
- ðŸ”² **2025-03-13**: Update Makefile and scripts for FreeBSD compatibility
- ðŸ”² **2025-03-20**: Complete comprehensive testing on FreeBSD
- ðŸ”² **2025-04-10**: Add FreeBSD to CI pipeline
- ðŸ”² **2025-04-24**: Finalize FreeBSD support documentation

## Notes for Developers

When developing across platforms:
- Use npm scripts when possible as they work consistently across platforms
- Test changes on both Linux/macOS and FreeBSD before merging
- Be aware of shell script compatibility issues, especially with date, grep, and sed
- Use node.js APIs for file operations rather than shell commands when possible
